      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to Ricked & Rolled – Where Memes and Dreams Meet.
        <br />
        Whether you're a meme historian, a prank enthusiast, or just got here by
        "accident," you're in the right place. Dive into the legendary lore of
        Rick Astley’s eternal anthem, explore classic and creative rickrolls,
        and discover the internet’s most beloved bait-and-switch in all its
        glory. You’ll never look at a link the same way again.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        At Ricked & Rolled, our mission is simple:
        <em
          >to never give you up, never let you down, and definitely never warn
          you before it’s too late</em
        >. We are the internet’s premiere archive, shrine, and trapdoor
        dedicated to the fine art of the rickroll. From vintage bait-and-clicks
        to cutting-edge meme warfare, we celebrate every glorious moment when
        someone thought they were getting free V-Bucks or breaking news—only to
        be met with a dancing Rick in glorious 480p.
      </p>

      <p>
        This site exists to document the history, evolution, and pure chaotic
        joy of one of the internet’s oldest and greatest pranks. Whether you're
        here to relive the classics, find inspiration for your next unsuspecting
        victim, or just accidentally got tricked into learning
        something—consider yourself part of the rickrolling legacy now. We’re
        not just a website. We’re a movement. A promise. A pixelated legend.
        Because when the world changes, trends fade, and memes come and go…
        <strong>Rick Astley remains</strong>.
