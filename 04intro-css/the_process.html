      <h1>The Process</h1>

      <h2>Prelude: What is Rickrolling?</h2>
      <p>
        Rickrolling is the art of tricking people to click on links to the song
        "Never Gonna Give You Up" by Rick Astley. Many versions of rick rolls
        have evolved over the years and here are the key parts of a rickroll.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>The Bait:</h3>
          <p>
            Start with an irresistible hook: a misleading link that promises
            something exciting—like "Early Access to GTA 6!" or "You Won’t
            Believe This Hack!" The goal is to lure the target in with
            curiosity.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>The Click:</h3>
          <p>
            The victim takes the bait and clicks the link, fully expecting to
            see what was promised. Suspicion? None. Expectations? High.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>The Drop:</h3>
          <p>
            And there it is—Rick Astley in glorious low-res video, serenading
            them with <em>"Never Gonna Give You Up."</em> The prank has landed.
            Realization dawns.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>The Aftermath:</h3>
          <p>
            The victim reacts—shock, betrayal, laughter, or plotting revenge.
            Maybe they even pass it on. The cycle continues. The internet
            remains undefeated.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        With time people have even started writing essays and papers about this
        song in order to try and lure in more people, such as this brilliant
        essay from the comment section of
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm3YgoEiEDc" target="_blank"
          >"10 Hours Rick Astley Never Gonna Give You Up"</a
        >.

        "This video was a masterpiece that is a requirement for all lovers of
        the internet. 1:26 created a heartwarming introduction to the plot,
        setting up a scene that makes you sympathize for the main character,
        crafted perfectly into setting up the starting scene. 2:34 was used to
        set up the tension between the characters, which has a beautiful, yet
        eerie feeling towards the viewer, which made me unable to sit back in my
        chair. 5:26 took me by a shocking surprise, hooking in the viewer to
        wanting to continue the video, engaging the viewers wonderfully into the
        heart breaking plot. At 9:10 the dialogue answered so many questions
        about the first video, making this sequel even better. I find it hard to
        believe the sequel could be better than the original, but here I stand
        corrected at this intense and fast paced action scene. The placement of
        this was truly phenomenal. I can’t even describe how amazing 16:52 was.
        Jaw… dropping. This was one of the saddest scenes ever crafted in video
        history. I may not cry all that often, especially at films, but I
        couldn’t help it at this scene, giving their life to keep their family
        safe, made me burst. This will have a major effect later in the story
        about the plot. I fell in love with the scene at 34:33, which was
        hilarious, yet showed the perfect tension between both characters,
        hardly seeming to remember why they were mad at each other. 46:51 was a
        confusing scene at first. I am not going to spoil it for the viewers of
        this video, but the feeling of anything being able to jump out at the
        character was giving me the goosebumps. 1:00:03 had a phenomenal plot
        twist, changing the entirety of the video, and future ones to come. It
        beautifully portrayed the concept of “show not tell, “ following the
        rules of freyjas pyramid about the key components to successful story
        telling. It left me in shock at how emotionally scarring this must be to
        all the characters. 1:16:12 was heartwarming yet funny at the same time.
        All the viewers will be crying with tears after this romance comedy
        scene. It takes a good break from the intensity of the other scenes
        surrounding this one. The plot of this story just keeps getting better
        despite me thinking it was impossible. Something about 1:45:19 made me
        feel uneasy, the music and lighting were set up perfectly so make the
        viewer think the scene has intensity, despite the characters not feeling
        the same way. The viewer knowing more than the character is a great
        craft move used by the writer, which leaves the viewer with predictions
        about later in the film. 2:16:54 the plot of this movie is astounding,
        but I could say that it makes me wonder how the video is much longer
        than this if the story seems to be practically over without some twist.
        2:53:16. SPEECHLESS. Just when you thought this video was over, POW, an
        amazingly intense, fast paced plot twist filled, exciting scene came up.
        I was supposed to be home 30 minutes ago, I am missing my sons birthday
        to be here for this . This is the peek of every video on YouTube, it
        literally can’t get any better than this. Any bad reviews against this
        movie should be considered a crime, and have the reviewer sentenced to
        three years. 3:18:19 had the excitement toned down a bit, which was well
        placed. The flash backs used here were very important towards
        summarizing what I have already watched so far, and what is to come
        later in the video. 3:52:41 was not quite what I was expecting, being
        more anticlimactic than I was expecting and hoping for. But despite
        this, it is the video of the century, and if you didn’t pick up on it
        yet, it is the most amazing, heartwarming, terrifying, plot twist
        filled, and overall best video on the entire internet. Thank you for
        your time. If you read this whole thing, <br />

        4:27:18 was a great comedy mix up. The joke was extremely well placed in
        the story, props to the actor for really selling it to, and of course
        the writer. Of course, that is the pro side of it, but tying back into
        the serious part of the plot, it probably should have been toned down a
        bit, nonetheless though I love it. 4:58:12 was very confusing to me. I’m
        not sure if the writers are trying to hint towards a sequel? I don’t see
        what more there is to say, but I’m hoping that it doesn’t turn into one
        of those over-milked stories for money. I’m not worried though, this
        video is phenomenal. 5:26:11 was heartwarming, I thought the character
        wasn’t going to make it at first, but the fact they did is making me
        almost cry. 6:01:10 I’m starting to lose track of how many plot twists
        there are, but this… this is AMAZING. Truly going to blow the minds of
        anybody. 6:47:19 This part was once again confusing, it tied back into
        when I wrote about at 46:15, it was confusing. Of course, the writers
        may be trying to figure something out. Maybe someone in the replies can
        tell me what they think is going to happen. <br />

        I just realized I might be spoiling this for every person about to watch
        the next 10 hours of this video, but despite that, why would someone
        read this if they were gonna spend the next 10 hours watching this.
        <br />

        Approaching 7:14:54 you may have trouble understanding this part of the
        film, but in reality my theory is that the character who died at 1:16:12
        actually was never killed the entire time. The writing just reels me in
        to the story amazingly, most watchers will instantly fall in love with
        the characters. I wish all people luck on this cinematic journey.
        7:33:19 was anticlimactic, the plot could have done anything here
        weather intense or slow paced, but they went with the most boring
        approach imaginable. I’m hoping it builds back up. <br />

        It built back up. HOW DID I NOT SEE THIS COMING at 7:51:43 pure… shock.
        I’m not going to get into it that much because I don’t want to spoil it
        even more than I need to or already have done, but I guess you’ll have
        to watch this part for yourself to truly get the experience. 8:01:19
        just reached the eight hour mark. Feeling tired. Gotta get a coffee,
        sorry for the delay in writing this may cause. <br />

        Alright I’m back, refueled from coffee. Time to continue writing. PS if
        you somehow are reading this part I did not get a coffee, I don’t like
        the taste. 8:19:14 is too over dramatic here. I mean, I appreciate the
        actors going over the top for this and not being embarrassed to do this,
        but come on this is just over the top. 8:43:11 cover your eyes. Just
        really. Cover your eyes. I don’t care if your over eighteen, just do it.
        Please. 8:51:19 I’m crying right now. I’m legit so relieved that the
        character didn’t die who I mentioned earlier twice. <br />

        Thank you writers of this for making the best film available on this
        planet."

      <h2>How Can I Rickroll Someone?</h2>
      <p>
        What an excellent question. There are many ways to rickroll someone, but
        it all begins with the most important ingredient: the link. A good
        rickroll needs a believable setup and a well-hidden delivery. First,
        choose your link carefully.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>Choose Your Link</h3>
          <p>
            Here are a few starter links you can use to begin your rickrolling
            journey:
          </p>

            </dt>
            <dd>
              The original, the legend, the one and only. This link is iconic—so
              iconic, in fact, that many people can spot it a mile away. Great
              for beginners, but not as effective on seasoned internet users.
            </dd>

            <dt>
              <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-HUgzYPm9g"

            </dt>
            <dd>
              Disguised as a short Star Wars clip, this version uses a different
              title and thumbnail to catch fans off guard. It's clever, clean,
              and catches people who think they're in for galactic lore.
            </dd>

            <dt>
              <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5a0jTc9S10"

            </dt>
            <dd>
              Who could resist clicking on a puppy video? This one takes
              advantage of the internet’s love of cute animals to deliver the
              ultimate surprise.
            </dd>
          </dl>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Hide the Link</h3>
          <p>
            Once you have your rickroll link, disguise it. Use a URL shortener
            (like
            <a href="https://bitly.com" target="_blank">bit.ly</a>) or hyperlink
            it behind a believable sentence. For example:
            <em>"“You’ve gotta see this lmao"</em> or
            <em>"I swear you’re gonna lose it at this"</em>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Deliver the Bait</h3>
          <p>
            Now comes the fun part. Share your disguised link in a group chat, a
            Discord server, a class document, or even in an email. Make sure
            your message sounds genuine and tempting enough to click.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Enjoy the Chaos</h3>
          <p>
            Sit back, relax, and wait for the reactions. Some will laugh, others
            will groan, and a few might vow revenge. Congratulations—you’ve just
            continued a proud internet tradition.
